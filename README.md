Squares String
============

Homework assignment to design an algorithm that will find the solution for the problem stated below.

“If we have a sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13, 14, 15 and we want this sequence to be in an order such that every number and the number next to it when added together form another number that is a perfect square. Perfect squares are numbers such as 4, 9, 16 etc which can be formed by squaring and integer.

An example of a correct solution to the above problem is:

8, 1, 15, 10, 6, 3, 13, 12, 4, 5, 11, 14, 2, 7, 9

Write a program in pseudo-code or code which can find solutions to this problem.”
